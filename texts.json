        "description": "Normal procedures are used by the trained flight crew to ensure airplane condition is acceptable and that the flight deck is correctly configured for each phase of flight. These procedures assume all systems are operating normally and automated features are fully utilized. Procedures are performed from recall and follow a panel flow. Checklists are used to verify that critical items affecting safety have been accomplished. These procedures are designed to minimize crew workload and are consistent with flight deck technology. During accomplishment of procedures, it is the crew member’s responsibility to ensure proper system response. If an improper indication is noted, first verify that the system controls are properly positioned. Then, if necessary, check the appropriate circuit breaker(s), and test related system light(s.) Before engine start, individual system lights are used to verify system status. If an individual system light is indicating an improper condition prior to engine start, determine if the condition may affect dispatch and require maintenance action or compliance with the Minimum Equipment List (MEL.) Boeing 737 Operations Manual Normal Procedures - Introduction After engine start, the MASTER CAUTION system, annunciator lights, and alerts are used as the primary means to alert the crew to a non-normal system condition. Illumination of the MASTER CAUTION and system annunciator lights requires accomplishment of the appropriate non–normal procedure. Upon completion of the procedure and prior to takeoff, the Dispatch Deviations Guide (DDG) or airline equivalent should be consulted to determine if MEL relief is available. Flight crew duties are organized in accordance with an area of responsibility concept. Each crewmember is assigned a flight deck area where the crewmember initiates actions for required procedures.The panel illustrations in this section describe each crewmember’s area of responsibility for pre/post flight and phase of flight. Pre/post flight duties are apportioned between the captain and first officer, while phase of flight duties are apportioned between the Pilot Flying (PF) and Pilot Not Flying (PNF.) A normal scan flow is encouraged; however, certain items may be handled in the most logical sequence for existing conditions. Actions outside the crew member’s area of responsibility are initiated at the direction of the captain. General phase of flight responsibilities are as follows: Pilot flying (PF): • flight path and airspeed control • airplane configuration • navigation. Pilot not flying (PNF): • checklist reading • communications • tasks requested by PF • start levers and fire switches (with PF concurrence.) Phase of flight duties, beginning with the Takeoff Procedure and ending with completion of the Landing Roll Procedure, are presented in table form in the appropriate procedures section. The first officer, when flying the airplane, performs the duties listed under PF, and the captain performs those duties listed under PNF. Note: Although the mode control panel is designated as the PF’s responsibility, the PNF should operate the controls on the mode control panel at the direction of the PF when the airplane is being flown manually. The captain retains final authority for all actions directed and performed. Boeing 737 Operations Manual Normal Procedures - Introduction"

        "description": "When the autopilot, flight director, or autothrottles are in use and a mode change is selected or is scheduled to occur, the annunciation must be verified on the flight mode annunciation display. Airplane course, vertical path, and speed must always be monitored. Similarly, when a thrust mode change is selected or is scheduled to occur, the annunciation must be verified on the thrust mode display. In LNAV and VNAV, all airplane course, vertical path, thrust and speed changes must be verified."

In flight, CDU entries are normally accomplished by the pilot not flying and verified by the pilot flying prior to execution. CDU entries should be accomplished prior to high workload periods such as departure, arrival, or holding. During high workload periods, using the autopilot modes such as heading select, level change, and the altitude and speed intervention features, if available, may be more efficient than entering complex route modifications into the CDU.

The primary method is to use it as a de–icer by allowing ice to accumulate before turning wing anti–ice on. This procedure provides the cleanest airfoil surface, the least possible runback ice formation, and the least thrust and fuel penalty. The secondary method is to use wing anti––ice prior to ice accumulation. Operate the wing anti–ice system as an anti–icer only during extended operations in moderate or severe icing conditions, such as holding. Ice accumulation on the flight deck window frames, windshield center post or on the windshield wiper arm may be used as an indication of structural icing conditions and the need to turn on wing anti–ice. Normally it is not necessary to shed ice periodically unless extended flight through icing conditions is necessary (holding).

September 30, 2002 Boeing 737 Operations Manual Supplementary Procedures - Adverse Weather • If cooling air is available from an outside source, the supply should be plugged in immediately after engine shutdown and should not be removed until just prior to engine start. • Keep all doors and windows, including cargo doors, closed as much as possible. • Electronic components which contribute to a high temperature level in the flight deck should be turned off while not needed. • Open all passenger cabin gasper outlets and close all window shades on the sun–exposed side of the passenger cabin. Brake temperature levels may be reached which can cause the wheel fuse plugs to melt and deflate the tires. Consider the following actions: • Be aware of brake temperature buildup when operating a series of short flight sectors. The energy absorbed by the brakes from each landing is accumulative. • Extending the landing gear early during the approach provides additional cooling for tires and brakes. • In–flight cooling time can be determined from the “Brake Cooling Schedule” in the Performance–Inflight section. During flight planning consider the following: • High temperatures inflict performance penalties which must be taken into account on the ground before takeoff. • Alternate takeoff procedures (No Engine Bleed Takeoff, Improved Climb Performance, etc.)"

        "description": "SP.16.15 If windshear is suspected, be especially alert to any of the danger signals and be prepared for the possibility of an inadvertent encounter. The following precautionary actions are recommended if windshear is suspected: Takeoff • Use maximum takeoff thrust instead of reduced thrust. • Use the longest suitable runway. • Be alert for any airspeed fluctuations during takeoff and initial climb. Such fluctuations may be the first indication of windshear. • Know the all–engine initial climb pitch attitude. Rotate at the normal rate to this attitude for all non–engine failure takeoffs. Minimize reductions from the initial climb pitch attitude until terrain and obstruction clearance is assured, unless stick shaker activates. • Crew coordination and awareness are very important. Develop an awareness of normal values of airspeed, attitude, vertical speed, and airspeed build–up. Closely monitor vertical flight path instruments such as vertical speed and altimeters. The pilot not flying should be especially aware of vertical flight path instruments and call out any deviations from normal. • Should airspeed fall below the trim airspeed, unusual control column forces may be required to maintain the desired pitch attitude. Stick shaker must be respected at all times. September 30, 2002 Boeing 737 Operations Manual Supplementary Procedures - Adverse Weather SP.16.16 • If windshear should be encountered near VR, and airspeed suddenly decreases, there may not be sufficient runway left to accelerate back to the normal VR. If there is insufficient runway left to stop, initiate a normal rotation at least 2000 feet before the end of the runway even if airspeed is low. Higher than normal attitudes may be required to lift–off in the remaining runway. Approach and Landing • Select the minimum landing flap position consistent with field length. • Add an appropriate airspeed correction (correction applied in the same manner as gust), the maximum command speed should not exceed the lower of Vref + 20 knots or landing flap placard speed minus 5 knots. • Avoid large thrust reductions or trim changes in response to sudden airspeed increases as these may be followed by airspeed decreases. • Crosscheck flight director commands using vertical flight path instruments. • Crew coordination and awareness are very important, particularly at night or in marginal weather conditions. Closely monitor the vertical flight path instruments such as vertical speed, altimeters, and glideslope displacement. The pilot not flying should call out any deviations from normal. Use of the autopilot and autothrottle for the approach may provide more monitoring and recognition time.

After landing at weights exceeding those shown above, adjusted for slope and wind, wait at least 62 minutes and check that wheel thermal plugs have not melted before executing a takeoff. As an alternate procedure, ensure that each brake pressure plate surface temperature, without artificial cool- ing, is less than 218°C as follows: No sooner than 10 and no later than 15 minutes after parking, measure each brake pressure plate surface temperature at a minimum of two points per brake by an accurate method (using a Doric Microtemp 450 hand held thermometer or equivalent, hold temperature probe in place for 20 seconds or until reading stabilizes). If each measured temperature is less than 218°C, immediate dispatch is allowed; otherwise the required minimum ground wait period of 62 minutes applies.

Tire and Brake Energy Limits are not shown as they are not limiting for the range of conditions shown in this chapter. JAROPS-1 requires that the runway length be adjusted to account for alignment of the airplane prior to takeoff. The table below provides TORA, TODA and ASDA adjustments for both 90 degree taxiway entry and 180 degree turnaround. For the 180 degree turnaround case, adjustments are provided for both a nominal 60 m runway as well as the minimum required for the stated minimum pavement width. These values may be used when obtaining takeoff weights from the Airplane Flight Manual or a takeoff analysis program.  When using line-up allowances with the Field Length Limit chart, the field length available must be reduced by the ASDA adjustment. 90 DEGREE TAXIWAY ENTRY 180 DEGREE TURNAROUND MINIMUM LINE-UP DISTANCE (M) NOMINAL LINE-UP DISTANCE  (M) (60.0 M RUNWAY) MINIMUM LINE-UP DISTANCE  (M) (24.4 M RUNWAY) TORA & TODA 9.6 15.0 15.0 ASDA 20.9 26.4 26.4"

        "description": "1.40.5 Exit lights are located throughout the passenger cabin to indicate the approved emergency exit routes. The system is controlled by a switch on the overhead panel. The switch has three positions, OFF, ARMED and ON and is guarded to the ARMED position. With the switch in the ARMED position, the emergency exit lights are normally extinguished. If electrical power to DC bus No. 1 fails or if AC power has been turned off, the emergency exit lights illuminate automatically. The emergency exit lights may also be illuminated by a switch on the aft attendants panel. Lifting the guard and pushing the switch ON overrides the flight deck control and illuminates the emergency exit lights. Control from this panel is available in the event of failure of the automatic control. The flight deck aft DOME light contains a separate bulb that is powered by the emergency lighting system to provide for flight deck evacuation.

Oxygen pressure is displayed on the Oxygen Pressure indicator located on the aft overhead panel when the battery switch is ON. Oxygen flow is controlled through an in-line, pressure-reducing regulator to supply low-pressure oxygen to the regulator on the mask. System pressure may be as high as 1850 psi. Oxygen flow is controlled by a regulator mounted on the oxygen mask. By pushing the NORMAL/100% control lever, the regulator is adjusted from the air/oxygen mixture to 100% oxygen. By rotating the EMERGENCY/PUSH TO TEST selector, the regulator is adjusted to supply oxygen under pressure. Flight Crew Oxygen Mask Usage Donning Instructions To don the mask, grasp the regulator with the thumb and forefinger and remove from stowage. Squeezing the inflation levers and removing from the box: • inflates the mask harness • momentarily displays a colored oxygen flow indicator. • Place the mask over the head and release the levers. The harness contracts to fit the mask to head and face. The observer’s oxygen mask, regulator, and harness unit is the same as the pilots’.

        "description": "1.40.13 The passenger oxygen system is supplied by individual chemical oxygen generators located at each Passenger Service Unit (PSU). Four continuous flow masks are connected to each generator. A generator with two masks is located above each attendant station and in each lavatory. September 30, 2002 Boeing 737 Operations Manual Airplane General, Emergency Equipment, Doors, Windows - Systems Description The system is activated automatically by a pressure switch at a cabin altitude of 14,000 feet or when the Passenger Oxygen Switch on the aft overhead panel is positioned to ON. When the system is activated, the PASS OXY ON light illuminates and OVERHEAD illuminates on the Master Caution System. Activating the system causes the masks to drop from the stowage compartments. The oxygen generators are activated when any mask in the unit is pulled down. Pulling one mask down causes all masks in that unit to come down and 100% oxygen flows to all masks. A green in–line flow indicator is visible in the transparent oxygen hose whenever oxygen is flowing to the mask. Oxygen flows for approximately 12 minutes and cannot be shut off. If the passenger oxygen is activated and a PSU oxygen mask compartment does not open, the masks may be dropped manually."
